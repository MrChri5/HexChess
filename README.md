# Hexagonal Chess

This chess board allows two players to play a game of hexagonal chess, following Glinski's Hexagonal Chess rules.

The board highlights which pieces the player can move and, when a piece is selected, which moves a piece can make.
The game can be saved, which outputs the moves so far in algebraic notation. This file can then be used to load the game.
The are test scenarios to demonstrate each pieces moves on the hexagonal board.
